this is a set of nlp task that are done as a lab exercise and some additional insights that i have gained


1)NLP_LAB_DAY1.pynb


This is the first task in which we are trying to work with nltk and used frequency and conditional frequency distribution. We also tried to use functions like concordance(), Len(), set(),tabulate(),sorted() and created a lexical dispersion plot as an additional work.
Here we have used brown corpus and frequency and conditional frequency distribution were used to find out the frequently occuring words.
